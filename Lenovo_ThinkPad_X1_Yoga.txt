The 14″ ThinkPad X1 Yoga Ultrabook from Lenovo is a lightweight laptop designed for on-the-go professionals who need a secure and portable system to keep up with them. To ensure your data is protected, the X1 Yoga is equipped with a fingerprint reader, power-on password protection, TPM (Trusted Platform Module), and a security keyhole slot. Performance-wise, it’s powered by a 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-8xx0U quad-core processor, 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM, and integrated Intel UHD graphics.


 

Its 14″ display has a FHD resolution and is built with an IPS (In-Plane Switching) display, delivering crisp and clear content with vivid colors and wide viewing angles.

A 512GB M.2 NVMe PCIe SSD is installed to store your files and multimedia content offering fast boot and load times. Moreover, this Opal2 drive is self encrypting for an additional layer of security. Should you need more space, you can attach external storage solutions using its multiple USB ports as well as its microSD card reader. Connect to the Internet via 802.11ac Wi-Fi and pair compatible wireless peripherals using Bluetooth 4.1 technology.

Other integrated features include Thunderbolt 3 ports, an HDMI port, speakers, a webcam with microphones, a backlit keyboard, and a mic/headphone combo jack. The operating system installed is Windows 10 Pro.

 

Thin, Light, and Durable

The ThinkPad X1 Yoga is constructed out of carbon fiber and magnesium alloy, making it thin, lightweight, and extremely durable. It also has passed nearly a dozen military-grade specification tests including dust, vibration, heat, cold, altitude, humidity, and more so you can rely on the ThinkPad despite what life throws your way.

 

Stay Unplugged

With the X1 Yoga, you can stay connected, or take it with you on the go, as the battery can last long hours on a single charge. Also, thanks to Rapid Charge technology, it can recharge up to 50% capacity in just one hour. Actual battery life will depend on use.

 

Extra Security

Because your data is critical, Lenovo has enhanced security to keep you safer than ever. The X1 Carbon includes a fingerprint reader, power-on password protection, TPM (Trusted Platform Module), and a security keyhole slot.

 

Thunderbolt 3

Thunderbolt 3 is a hardware interface that utilizes the reversible USB Type-C connector. Doubling the speed of its predecessor, Thunderbolt 3 features a maximum throughput of 40 Gb/s when used with compatible devices. The connector also transmits data via USB 3.1 at up to 10 Gb/s, and dual-bandwidth DisplayPort 1.2 allows you to connect up to two 4K displays simultaneously. Additionally, you can daisy chain up to six devices from a single Thunderbolt 3 port.
